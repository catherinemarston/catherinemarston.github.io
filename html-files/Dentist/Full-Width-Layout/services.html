									<h5>Teeth Whitening</h5>

											<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
													<p>
															We use Opalescence®, an at-home whitening technique, utilizing custom-made trays. Another advantage to the tray system is that it allows our patients to refresh their whitening results using the appliances many years into the future. We also offer
															ZOOM! whitening system as a "jump start" to a whiter brighter smile in about an hour!

									<h5>Dental Veneers</h5>
									<hr>
									<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
													<p>
															Veneers are used to fix the appearance of one's front teeth. It can change the color, shape, size, alignment of teeth or otherwise damaged teeth. They can be used to correct one imperfection or a combination of imperfections. Veneers are thin "slip
															covers" made of porcelain that are bonded to the front surface of your existing teeth, making them indistinguishable from your own natural teeth.

											<h5>Porcelain Crown</h5>
											<hr>
											<div class="row">
													<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
															<p>
																	Porcelain crowns have the most natural look and are generally indistinguishable from natural teeth. Due to advancement in ceramics they are every bit as strong as metal or PFM crowns. New CAD/CAM techniques allow dentists to create crowns in minutes,
																	but the procedure is typically costly. Porcelain crowns made in this way wear at the same rate as natural teeth.
																	<br/>
																	If you are looking to have the smile you always wanted, we would be happy to sit down with you to discuss what we can accomplish for you.

															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			<p>
																					"Smile Makeover" is a popular term, today. Whether on TV or in the latest fashion magazine, you will likely hear about the “life changing” effects of a person's smile makeover. In terms of cosmetic (or esthetic dentistry), smile makeovers can
																					typically correct most deficiencies in a person's smile.
																					<br/>
																					One popular cosmetic dentistry technique used in smile makeovers is teeth whitening. Although effective for adjusting tooth color, teeth whitening is not effective in correcting other dental deficiencies. Compared to teeth whitening, all-ceramic
																					dental veneers and dental crowns can both improve the color of a person's teeth, and can additionally correct problems like chipped, cracked, or crooked teeth. To see how we can help with your smile makeover, contact us!

													<h5>Single Tooth Implant</h5>
													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			Single-tooth implants can be used in people who are missing one or more teeth. An implant is surgically placed in the jawbone. After the implant integrates (attaches) to your bone, it acts as a new "root" for the crown that will replace your missing
																			tooth.<strong>
																					A crown (cap)</strong>, which is made to look like a natural tooth, is attached to the implant and fills the space left in the mouth by the missing tooth. Call us now to discuss more!
																	</p>

													<h5>Multi-teeth & Full arch Implants</h5>
													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			We can replace teeth individually with implants and crowns, or we can place implants that are used to support full or partial dentures, as well as fixed bridges. If your jawbone is adequate to support a<strong>fixed bridge</strong>, we can place
																			several implants along the jawbone to provide support for this type of dental restoration. This procedure is comparable to single and multiple implants procedures, and it requires planning to ensure we place an adequate number of implants in ideal
																			positions that make it possible for us to fabricate a bridge that meets your needs and expectations.
																			<br/>
																			Implants are designed to be a life-long solution, and hurrying the process can lead to less-than-ideal results. We encourage you to avoid quick-fix promises, and instead look for
																			<strong>long-lasting, beautiful results.</strong>
																			Please call us to schedule an evaluation to determine if you are a good candidate for dental implants.
																	</p>

													<h5>Implant Supported Dentures</h5>
													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			Loose dentures no more! Dental implants can be used to hold and retain removable prosthetics. These prosthetics, known as implant overdentures, are recommended if you are missing all of the teeth in your lower or upper jaw, but you still have enough
																			healthy bone structure to support implants.
																			<br/>
																			Once we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and determine that you are a candidate for implant overdentures, we will place implants at ideal locations into the jaw and give them time to integrate themselves into the bone, like natural tooth roots.
																			Once fully healed, we will add custom snaps to the prostheses to which your denture will be attached.

													<h5>Teeth in a day!</h5>
													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			Tooth loss, gum disease, and bone loss affect millions of people worldwide, resulting in edentulous (no teeth) jaws. With new innovative solutions this no longer has to be the case. Our most advanced dental procedure is the<strong>"Same Day Fixed Teeth"</strong>
																			, an implant procedure in which the implants are placed, and teeth are fixed into the implants all on the same day.
																			<br/>
																			This enables the patient to come into the office and leave with new teeth that are stable, and do not have to be removed. There is no annoying acrylic material covering the palate of the mouth, and no more use of gummy pastes. No longer do you have
																			to take out your teeth daily or to remove the teeth to clean. It is like having natural teeth again. Call our office to find out more!</p>

													<h5>Comprehensive Exam</h5>
													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																			Whereas a dental visit used to focus on treating tooth decay, it has evolved to address dental health as it relates to total health and overall well-being. We are a wellness-centered practice that emphasizes on the prevention of dental disease and
																			the creation and maintenance of a healthy mouth and beautiful smile as part of one’s overall health.
																		<p>
																			Unlike one-tooth dentistry, comprehensive dental care looks at the interrelationship of the teeth, gums, supporting bone and jaw muscles. These structures of the oral cavity must work in harmony to allow us to speak, chew, and smile for a lifetime.
																			</p>
																			In our initial exam, we do not simply scan the mouth for cavities and tooth problems. We look at the health of each of the structures contributing to a healthy mouth and educate our patients on ways to achieve and maintain oral health for the rest of
																			their lives.
																			<p>
																			We put particular emphasis on maintaining and restoring the teeth to their natural form and function while focusing on creating and maintaining a beautiful smile for our patients. When dentistry is done to the highest level, no one should be able to
																			detect that you have had dental work completed. Whether it is the front teeth or the last tooth in the back, We promise to give each patient the same attention to detail and level of care.</p>

																		Our Radiographic Technology is the Best Available. Digital X-Rays offer many advantages, including:

																		<br /> - Interactive Diagnostics

																		Digital Technology is important to our practice because it allows us to transfer information immediately and without any inconvenience to our patients.

													<hr>
													<div class="row">
															<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
																	<p>
																		Following a thorough dental cleaning and exam at Boston North Dental Associates, you will notice your dentist and hygienists studying the far corners of your mouth and palpating your neck and chin. We are not performing a relaxing massage, but are conducting one of the most important aspects of your exam; an oral cancer screening.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		More than <strong>43,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal cancer this year</strong>, 8,000 of which will lose their lives to this devastating disease, according to the Oral Cancer Foundation. Oral cancer is not difficult to diagnose, but there is not a comprehensive program in the U.S. to opportunistically screen for the disease. Therefore, the cancer often is discovered late in its development. Click here to learn more.
